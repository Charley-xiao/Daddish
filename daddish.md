## Welcome

Welcome to the tutorial of **Daddish**, a constructed language created by [me](https://github.com/Charley-xiao). From the following tutorial, you will acquire a basic knowledge of the grammar of Daddish and learn to speak it.



## Introduction

Daddish is the official language of Dad Republic (Daddish: *Konharmonёšost Dadad*), Earth 0xffffffff. Daddish was invented by a linguist, **Vasily Xiao** (Daddish: *Šjao Vasinёo*), and was promoted nationwide in Dad Republic since its birth.

## Alphabet

The alphabet of Daddish is pretty easy, which includes all the letters of the English alphabet except `q`, `w`, `x` and `y`. And there are also `š` and `č`, which respectively represent the sounds `sh` (as in `shove`) and `ch` (as in `chance`). The letter `ё` represents the sound `[jo]`, same as that in Russian.

## Verb

### Construction

The verbs in Daddish are very constructed. The original form of a verb always ends with `č`. If we take that `č` away, we call the rest the **root** of the verb. Basically a conjugated verb looks like this:
$$
\rm (Negative\ Prefix)+(Directional\ Prefix)+(Aspect\ Prefix)+Root+Person+Number+Time\&Type+(Voice)
$$
Besides, note that, for the suffixes to attach, it follows the rule of **vowel harmony**. The vowels in suffixes are always consistent with the last vowel of the root (with a few exceptions).

Additionally, when attaching a suffix, you need to pay attention to the end of the word. Let's say you are attaching the suffix `f` to the morpheme `lek`. `lek` ends with a consonant `k`, so it should be `lekef` after conjugation. Similarly, if the ending is a vowel,  `f` becomes `fa/fe/fi/fo/fu` instead of `af/ef/if/of/uf`.

### Person&Number

In Daddish, the concept of "plural" doesn't work. Daddish has three types of numbers: `Singular`, `Type II` and `Type III`.

`Singular`, also `Type I`, is used to represent things in total of 1. `Type II` is used for 2,3,4 and numbers that end with 2,3,4. `Type III` is for those that cannot fit in `Type I` or `Type II`.

Here comes the conjugation table of $\rm Person$:

| First Person |         Second Person          | Third Person |
| :----------: | :----------------------------: | :----------: |
|      f       | r (Inclusive) / ss (Exclusive) |      t       |

And $\rm Number$:

| Singular | Type II | Type III |
| :------: | :-----: | :------: |
|  (None)  |    v    |    k     |

Thankfully this works for nouns too!

Example:

| (a) machine | (2,3,4...) machines | (5...) machines |
| :---------: | :-----------------: | :-------------: |
|   maščin    |    maščin**iv**     |  maščin**ik**   |

### Time&Type

Tense consists of aspect and time. There are three times in Daddish: Past, Present, and Future.

There are also three types: declarative, imperative, and reportative. Reportative is used when the speaker is reporting what was told.

|                 | Past | Present | Future |
| :-------------: | :--: | :-----: | :----: |
| **Declarative** |  m   |    š    |   g    |
| **Imperative**  |  šd  |   šd    |   šd   |
| **Reportative** | ktm  |   ktš   |  ktg   |

Now that you have learned all the basic verb conjugation, we can make some sentences:

**Seve leporokotovoktm sjadvimaščinih.** *They(Type II) are said to have got a car.*

**Se** (*He*)+ **ve**= **Seve** (*They*,Type II)

**le** (*come*)+ **po** (perfective prefix)+ **rok** (*hand*)+ **č**= **leporokč** (*to get*)

**leporok** (root of *to get*)+ **ot** (third person)+ **ov** (Type II)+ **oktm** (past reportative)= **leporokotovoktm** (*are said to have got*)

**sjad** (*self*)+ **vi** (*move*)+ **maščin** (*machine*)+ **ih** (accusative)= **sjadvimaščinih**(*car*, accusative)



## Noun

### Construction

The nouns in Daddish are usually constructed in such way:
$$
\rm Prefix+Root+Suffix\ with\ a\ Meaning+Number+Case+Article
$$
We have already discussed the $\rm Number$ in the previous section.

### Article

In Daddish, there is only definite article. But the definite article can sometimes be omitted, and sometimes can even express the meaning of "that/this/those/these". The definite article looks like this:
$$
\rm ...-ta/te/ti/to/tu
$$
The vowel, again, should be in line with the root's. Articles don't do case conjugation.

### Case

There are nine grammar cases in Daddish:

|    Nominative    |                      (None)                      |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------------: |
|   **Genitive**   |                        d                         |
|    **Dative**    |                        z                         |
|  **Accusative**  |                        h                         |
| **Instrumental** | $\rm [vowel]+hm$ or $\rm [consonant]+[vowel]+hm$ |
|   **Locative**   |                        p                         |
|  **Topicative**  |                        c                         |
|   **Ablative**   |                        b                         |
|   **Vocative**   |                        s                         |

#### Nominative

The nominative case marks the subject of a verb. When the verb is active, the nominative is the person or thing doing the action; when the verb is passive, the nominative is the person or thing receiving the action.

- **Malcik-ti** glazatam boloh-to. *The boy saw the ball.*
- **Bol-to** glazatamsja malcikihm-ti. *The ball was seen by the boy.*

#### Genitive

The genitive case has the basic usage of showing possession, along with other derived usage.

1. **possession**
   - thinkik **Dzaneted** *Janet's drinks*
2. **composition**
   - kup **manakad** *a group of men*
3. **reference**
   - kapital **konharmonёšostod-to** *capital of the republic*

#### Dative

The dative case is used to mark the indirect object.

- Se darokotom **malcikiz** giftih. *He gave a boy a gift.*

It can be also used to express the meaning of "to somebody".

- **Seze** ce delo tovnёo. *To him, it is a good deed.*

#### Accusative

The accusative case is used to mark a direct object, or after a few prepositions.

- **Tehe** amofošo. *I love you.*
- Musufug fu-**dvaha** sekunduvud. *I will talk for two seconds.*

#### Instrumental

The instrumental case shows the meaning of "by means of" or "by use of", or, in passive voice, shows the agent of an action.

- Pišifiš **penehm**. *I'm writing with a pen.*

- Bol-to glazatamsja **malcikihm-ti**. *The ball was seen by the boy.*

#### Locative

The locative case shows the location or time.

- **Moskvapa** ce komennёe. *In Moscow, this is common.*

#### Topicative

The topicative case is a unique case in Daddish. It marks the topic, usually something the speaker is talking about.

- **Šotoc** ke knosotoš-c! *About death, who knows!*

#### Ablative

The ablative case expresses the meaning of "out of" or "from".

- Ce hobotomsjo **manab**. *This was stolen from a man.*

#### Vocative

The vocative case is a grammatical case which is used for a noun that identifies a person (animal, object, etc.) being addressed.

- **Dzjonos**, verešd! *John, come!*



## Adjective&Adverb

In Daddish, there are two types of adjectives: **restrictive** and **non-restrictive**. The original form of a restrictive adjective ends with `tornё`, while a non-restrictive one just ends with `nё`.

And adjectives also conjugates:
$$
\rm ...nё+[the\ last\ vowel\ in\ the\ root\ of\ the\ modified\ noun]+[corresponding\ case\ ending,\ just\ like\ a\ noun]
$$


- Djakak kelez titekez **tovnёeze**! *Thanks to all great teachers.* (non-restrictive, indicating all teachers are great, and thanking all the teachers)
- Djakak kelez titekez **tovtornёeze**! *Thanks to all teachers who are great!* (restrictive, indicating you are only thanking good teachers, not bad ones)

 Adverbs are often derived from adjectives, by changing the `nё` into `no`. Adverbs never conjugate.

### Compound Structure

Non-restrictive:

- Prinscipl Vzimvidostod **uroktoknёi Einsteinehm ku šokčotomnёi fizikmestostod** *Principle of Relativity, which was brought up by Einstein and shocked the field of physics*

The adherent adjuncts are connected with `ku`, which means `and`. `al` can be also used, which means `or`.

Restrictive:

- rubblat-ta **s-vahtahm Viniidi kutor ustoktornёa fu-markostoh** *that red pen with Winnie the Bear on it which is used for marking*

The adherent adjuncts are connected with `kutor` instead of `ku`, and `altor` instead of `al`.

|             |                      |               |



## Not-Attributive-Clause

Breaking news: there is no such thing as an "attributive clause" in Daddish. The meaning of the clause is expressed by compound structure, which consists of special adjectives derived from nouns and other stuffs.
